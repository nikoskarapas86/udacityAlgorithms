## in this problem we should rearrange the digits in a list to be [0,0,0...1,1,1,1,..2,2,...]

## we should accieve that in a single iteration and in the same list without creating a new list

## time complexity is `O(n)` due to single itteration

## space complexity is `O(1)`

## method change_position requires time complexity O(1) constant time and space complexity O(1)

## method sort_012 requires time complexity O( n) andspace complexity O(1)

# Autocomplete with Tries

## The .find() method iterates on prefixes with a for loop ,the time ## complexity will be `O(n)` space complexity will be `O(1)`

## The .suffixes() method iterates on prefix node with a for loop.the time complexity will be `O(n)` space complexity will be `O(1)`

## the above method will return a list of correspondent suffixes.

## The .insert() method iterates on each word with a for loop.the time complexity will be `O(n)` space complexity will be `O(1)`

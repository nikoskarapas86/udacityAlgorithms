## HTTPRouter using a Trie

## For this exercise we are going to implement an HTTPRouter like you would find in a typical web server using the Trie data structure we learned previously.

## There are many different implementations of HTTP Routers such as regular expressions or simple string matching, but the Trie is an excellent and very efficient data structure for this purpose.

## The purpose of an HTTP Router is to take a URL path like "/", "/about", or "/blog/2019-01-15/my-awesome-blog-post" and figure out what content to return. In a dynamic web server, the content will often come from a block of code called a handler.

## Time complexity:

## The time complexity for search, insert, and delete a trie is porpotional on the length of the word .

## A word can be inserted, or deleted or added

## lets suppose that we have `n` words that each on consisted of `m` length of characters

## Time complexity for these operations `O(n\*m)

## more spesifically :

# 1

# method insert() in class RouteTrie takes time complexity O(n) and space complexity O(1) while

# 2

# method insert() in RouteTrieNode takes time complexity O( 1) space complexity O(1)

# 3

# method find() takes time complexity O(n) and space complexity O(1)

# 4

# method add_handler() time complexity O(1) space complexity O(1)

# 5

# method lookup() time complexity O(n +n)=> O(n) thats due to split_path method and find method so overall time complexity is the addition of n+ n => n space complexity O(1)

# 6

# method split_path() takes O(n + n) => O(n) time complexity that sdue to diferent python methods strip() and split() , each one of them takes O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity .Finally the space complexity will be O(1)

# time complexity and space complexity for both init methods woul be O(1) [for time and space complexity]

# 7

## init() method in Router class takes `O(1)` time complexity and space complexity will be `O(1)`

# 8

## init() method in RouteTrieNode class takes `O(1)` time complexity and space complexity will be `O(1)`

# 9

## init() method in RouteTrie class takes `O(1)` time complexity and space complexity will be `O(1)`

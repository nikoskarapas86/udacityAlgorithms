## a maximum number is been consisted with the largest digit appears first,second largest digit appears second,

## second largest digit appears second

## first we should sort the array Sorting: `O(nlog(n))` // for using mergesort

## and construct two numbers by picking alternating digits at odd indices and the even indices of the sorted array. in one for loops: `O(n)` and space compexity `O(1)`

## Time complexity:

## Total: `O(nlogn + n)` => `O(nlog(n))`

## mergeSort takes `O(nlog(n))` time complexity and `O(n)` space complexity

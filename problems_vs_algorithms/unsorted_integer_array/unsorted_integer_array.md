# Unsorted Integer Array

## we create two variables minNumber and maxNumber(we assign them as value the first item of list) in a single iteration we can

## check if every number is grater or smaller than maxNumber and minNumber respectively

## we update the numbers maxNumber,minNumber

## finally we return them as tupple

## Time complexity => `O(n)` due to one single iteration

## space complexity => `O(1)` we don't create variables in for loop

## Ok that was the most exiteted task so far !!!!!!

## we use two classes `Block` and `BlockChain`

## `Block` class contain all the necesary information tha contains the block

## `BlockChain` class is the structure of blockchain it is similar to a `LinkedList`

## Time Complexity:

## `append` takes `O(1)`

## `getSize` takes `O(1)`

## `search` takes `O(n)`

## `convertBlockChainToList` takes `O(n)`

## Total: `O(1 + 1 + n + n)` => `O(n)`

## Space Complexity:

## Space complexity is `O(n)`

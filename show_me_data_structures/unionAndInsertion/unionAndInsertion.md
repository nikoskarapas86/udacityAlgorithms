## in that problem we create two methods `intersection` and `union`

## `union` returns a linked list that contains all values of two different linkedlist without their doublications

## `intersection` returns a linked list that contains all common values of two different linkedlist without their doublications

## a set is a data structure that doesnt allow doublications

## Time complexity for union is `O(n)` and space complexity is `O(n)`.

## 2 whiles and 1 for loop `O(n + n + n)`=> `O(n)`

## Time complexity for intersection is `O(n)` and space complexity is `O(n)`.

## 2 whiles and 1 for loop `O(n + n + n)`=> `O(n)`
